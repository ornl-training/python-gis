This is an introduction to Pandas designed for participants with some basic Python programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). It starts with 
an introduction to importing CSV files using the Pandas package, then moves on to work with data frames, how to calculate summary information from a data frame, and a brief 
introduction to plotting. Then it covers some more advanced stuff.

> ## Getting Started
>
> Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
> their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient 
> workflow. <br>**These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools.**
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup/)" tab to 
> download data to your computer and follow any installation instructions.
