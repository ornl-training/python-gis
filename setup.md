> ## Data
{: .prereq}
For this lesson, we will use a number of different data sets. Download these files to your computer. Once you click on them they should be automatically downloaded to your default download directory. Some browsers may require you to right click on the link to specify the download location.

- [surveys.csv](../data/surveys.csv)
- [surveys_complete.csv](../data_output/surveys_complete.csv)
- [species.csv](../data/species.csv)
- [speciesSubset.csv](../data/speciesSubset.csv)
- [bouldercreek_09_2013.txt](../data/bouldercreek_09_2013.txt)
- [monthly.ao.index.b50.current.ascii](../data/monthly.ao.index.b50.current.ascii)
- [norm.nao.monthly.b5001.current.ascii](../data/norm.nao.monthly.b5001.current.ascii)

> ## Software
{: .prereq}
[Python](http://python.org) is a popular language for
scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.

For this workshop we use Python version 3.x.

## Required Python Packages for this workshop

* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/)

## Install the workshop packages

For installing these packages we will use Anaconda. 
Anaconda is a Python distribution aimed at data science.

### Anaconda installation

Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
Remember to download and install the installer for <b>Python 3.x</b> for your
platform.

You can download either the graphical or command-line installer. If you
download the command line installer, you will need to run the installer
using the `sh` command. For example, if you downloaded 
`Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`, you would need to run the command:

```
sh Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

It is usually necessary to restart your shell once you've installed Anaconda.

### ggplot installation

Run the command:

```
conda install ggplot
```

In some cases, installing `ggplot` from conda may fail with an error like:

```
UnsatisfiableError:The following specifications were found to be in conflict:
      - ggplot -> python3.4*
      - python 3.6*
```

In that case, try installing `ggplot` with Anaconda `pip` by running this command in your terminal:

```
pip install -U ggplot
```

## Launch a Jupyter notebook

After installing either Anaconda or Miniconda and the workshop packages,
launch a Jupyter notebook by typing this command from the terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook should open automatically in your browser. If it does not or you
wish to use a different browser, open this link: <http://localhost:8888>.

## Overview of the Jupyter notebook (Optional)

### How the Jupyter notebook works

After typing the command `jupyter notebook`, the following happens:

* A Jupyter Notebook server is automatically created on your local machine.
* The Jupyter Notebook server runs locally on your machine only and does not
  use an internet connection.
* The Jupyter Notebook server opens the Jupyter notebook client, also known
  as the notebook user interface, in your default web browser.

  ![Jupyter notebook file browser](../fig/00_1_jupyter_file_browser.png)  
  *The Jupyter notebook file browser*

* To create a new Python notebook select the "New" dropdown on the upper
  right of the screen.

  ![Jupyter notebook file browser](../fig/00_2_jupyter_new_notebook.png)  
  *The Jupyter notebook file browser*

* When you can create a new notebook and type code into the browser, the web
  browser and the Jupyter notebook server communicate with each other.

* Under the "help" menu, take a quick interactive tour of how to
  use the notebook. Help on Jupyter and key workshop packages is
  available here too.

  ![Jupyter tour and help](../fig/00_4_jupyter_tour_help.png)  
  *User interface tour and Help*

* The Jupyter Notebook server does the work and calculations, and the web
  browser renders the notebook.
* The web browser then displays the updated notebook to you.

* For example, click in the first cell and type some Python code.

  ![Code cell](../fig/00_5_jupyter_code_before.png)  
  *A Code cell*

* This is a **Code** cell (see the cell type dropdown with the word **Code**).
  To run the cell, type Shift-Enter.

* Let's look at a **Markdown** cell. Markdown is a text manipulation
  language that is readable yet offers additional formatting. Don't forget
  to select **Markdown** from the cell type dropdown. Click in the cell and
  enter the markdown text.

This workflow has several advantages:

- You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.
- Tab completion allows you to easily access the names of things you are using
  and learn more about them.
- It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text,
  bullets, etc. to make information more accessible to you and your
  collaborators.
- It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them
  to tell a complete story of the analysis.

### How the notebook is stored

* The notebook file is stored in a format called JSON and has the suffix
  `.ipynb`.
* Just like HTML for a webpage, what's saved in a notebook file looks
  different from what you see in your browser.
* But this format allows Jupyter to mix software (in several languages) with
  documentation and graphics, all in one file.

### Notebook modes: Control and Edit

The notebook has two modes of operation: Control and Edit. Control mode lets
you edit notebook level features; while, Edit mode lets you change the
contents of a notebook cell. Remember a notebook is made up of a number of
cells which can contain code, markdown, html, visualizations, and more.

### Help and more information

Use the **Help** menu and its options when needed.
